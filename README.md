# Pentesting Scripts Collection

A small collection of Python scripts for practicing and demonstrating common **offensive security techniques**.  
‚ö†Ô∏è **For educational and lab use only. Do not use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to test.**

## üìÇ Scripts

### 1. `check_id_valid.py`
- Validates Israeli ID numbers using the checksum algorithm.
- Multiplies digits by alternating weights (1/2), sums, and checks divisibility by 10.
- Returns `True` for valid IDs, `False` otherwise.

### 2. `blind_sqli_extractor.py`
- Demonstrates **Boolean-based Blind SQL Injection**.
- Extracts password hashes from a vulnerable web app:
  - Determines if a user exists.
  - Finds password length.
  - Extracts hash character by character (linear or binary search).
- Tracks number of queries performed.

### 3. `hash_cracker.py`
- Brute-forces a SHA-256 hash using the **rockyou.txt** wordlist.
- Computes `sha256sumhex` for each candidate and compares to the target.
- Logs attempts and stops on success.

### 4. `ssh_bruteforce.py`
- Attempts SSH login against a target host (`127.0.0.1` by default).
- Iterates over `ssh-common-passwords.txt`.
- Reports the first valid password discovered.

### 5. `web_bruteforce.py`
- Performs credential brute-force against a vulnerable web login form.
- Tests multiple usernames (`admin`, `user`, `test`) with **rockyou.txt**.
- Detects success by searching for a marker string (`welcome back`) in the HTTP response.
